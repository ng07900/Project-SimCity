simulationfilereader.cpp
this class has all the methods to read and process the files, it is tested on 'config1.txt' and 'region1.csv' files.
simulationfilereader.h
dont forget to include both .cpp and .h files in the same project.

city map class is just created to test the reading functionality.

main.cpp demonstrates the initial region read from file and updates it after the time give in config file.
(as no other functionality is included, so the status remains same after each time interval.)
